      <h1>Agatha Christie</h1>
      <p>
        Dame Agatha Mary Clarissa Christie, Lady Mallowan, DBE (née Miller; 15
        September 1890 – 12 January 1976) was an English writer known for her 66
        detective novels and 14 short story collections, particularly those
        revolving around fictional detectives Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple.
        She also wrote the world's longest-running play, The Mousetrap, which
        has been performed in the West End since 1952, as well as six novels
        under the pseudonym Mary Westmacott. In 1971, she was made a Dame (DBE)
        for her contributions to literature. Guinness World Records lists
        Christie as the best-selling fiction writer of all time, her novels
        having sold more than two billion copies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Christie was born into a wealthy upper-middle-class family in Torquay,
        Devon, and was largely home-schooled. She was initially an unsuccessful
        writer with six consecutive rejections, but this changed in 1920 when
        The Mysterious Affair at Styles, featuring detective Hercule Poirot, was
        published. Her first husband was Archibald Christie; they married in
        1914 and had one child before divorcing in 1928. During both World Wars,
        she served in hospital dispensaries, acquiring a thorough knowledge of
        the poisons which featured in many of her novels, short stories, and
        plays. Following her marriage to archaeologist Max Mallowan in 1930, she
        spent several months each year on digs in the Middle East and used her
        first-hand knowledge of his profession in her fiction.
